                    <p>GREYRALLY values a safe and transparent environment for its users.
                      We want to make sure you, as a buyer or seller, understand what information we collect from you and
                      why. We also want you to know about how we use your information so that you can make good
                      decisions about how you use GREYRALLY. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect
                      from and about you and what we do with it.</p>
                    <p>1. THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT<br />
                      a. We collect information from you when you create an account so that you can use the Services.<br />
                      b. We collect information to help ensure GREYRALLY works properly.<br />
                      c. We collect to improve user experience. This may include using aggregations of information
                      collected and enriched for analytical purposes.<br />
                      1.1. Information We Collect Directly From You<br />
                      <br />
                      When you create an account with GREYRALLY, you are required to provide profile information,
                      including your name (if you wish to be able to contact GREYRALLY for dispute resolution), company
                      name (if applicable), username, password and a valid email address. GREYRALLY stores this
                      information to help identify you when you log in and help you communicate with other users. <br />
                      <br />
                      Once you've registered with GREYRALLY, you create a user profile where you post information to
                      help you communicate with other GREYRALLY users. Your profile information includes your username
                      and user identification number. We may display your profile information on our site, so that other
                      users of GREYRALLY and visitors to our web site will be able to see that profile information. You may
                      choose to display your name or company for greater visibility. <br />
                      <br />
                      If you are a Buyer, in addition to your profile information, you may provide us with financial
                      information, including your credit card or debit card information, or your banking information, or wallet
                      information in order to assist us in exchange of payload, making payment for payloads, or collecting
                      GREYRALLY Fees. <br />
                      <br />
                      If you are a Seller, in addition to your profile information, you may provide us with other personally
                      identifying information, including your mailing address, your social security number (or tax
                      identification number), wallet information, and/or your banking or PayPal information in order to allow
                      us to pay you monetary awards from Buyers. If you are Seller, your name may be a pseudonym
                      instead of a legal name. <br />
                      <br />
                      In addition to personal information, we collect any Vulnerability Reports and content that you submit,
                      post, or display on the Services. </p>
                    <p>1.2. Information We Automatically Collect<br />
                      We receive information automatically when you visit GREYRALLY. We do not intentionally collect
                      information about the device, browser and operating system you use when accessing our site and
                      Services. For the purposes of improving our services and preventing abuse, we may collect your IP
                      address, which pages you request and visit, and the date and time of each request you make to
                      GREYRALLY. If you visit GREYRALLY when you are logged into your account, we also collect the
                      user identification number we assign you when you open your account.<br />
                      <br />
                      We retain access logs associated with accounts making a purchase or sale for one hundred-eighty
                      (180) days after the close of escrow, and then delete them.</p>
                    <p>1.3. Cookie Policy<br />
                      When you log in to your account, GREYRALLY will place a cookie for the purpose of creating the
                      session and knowing when you're logged in. The cookie contains an encrypted user identifier.</p>
                    <p>2. HOW WE USE OR DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION<br />
                      We may use your information when needed to keep the site and Services running and prevent abuse.
                      Your Information is used internally only where necessary to provide our Services. Any use of vendors
                      or sharing or information to third parties shall be strictly controlled and in accordance with these
                      terms. Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use any personal information
                      we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.<br />
                      <br />
                      Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, we will only share your information, and any
                      information you provide (including Vulnerability Reports), with your prior consent, and after letting you
                      know what information will be shared and with whom. We do not sell Your Information to any third
                      party.<br />
                      <br />
                      When you enter into a financial transaction related to our Services (to pay us or to be paid by us), we
                      may, directly or through a third-party payment services provider, collect the financial information
                      about you described above, all of which will be treated as Your Information for purposes of this
                      Privacy Policy. We will use this information solely in connection with the financial transaction and will
                      not share this information with third parties, except to the extent necessary to complete the financial
                      transaction or comply with applicable law.<br />
                      <br />
                      For Sellers who participate in certain Programs of particular Buyers, to the extent described in the
                      Program Policies, GREYRALLY may share contact information about those Sellers (name, company
                      name (if applicable) and email address) to allow those Buyers to contact those Sellers to allow them to
                      interact directly.<br />
                      <br />
                      We may share aggregated information and non-identifying information with third parties for industry
                      research and analysis, demographic profiling and other similar purposes. We may occasionally
                      publish industry reports to assist the community, in development, for research, or to improve
                      community security standards; in no event will particular individuals, groups, or sales be exposed or
                      discussed in a way that violates these terms and principles without prior consent.
                      Information that we collect from all of our users, including Your Information, is considered to be a
                      business asset. Thus, if we are acquired by a third party as a result of a transaction such as a merger,
                      acquisition or asset sale, some or all of our assets may be disclosed or transferred to a third party
                      acquirer in connection with the transaction. In the event of bankruptcy or dissolution, information
                      relating to individuals will be destroyed.<br />
                      <br />
                      We will cooperate with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and
                      comply with the law. We may disclose Your Information to government or law enforcement officials or
                      private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate: (i) to comply with law,
                      regulation or valid legal process (including orders and subpoenas); or (ii) to protect our property, rights
                      and safety and the property, rights and safety of a third party or the public in general. If we are going
                      to release Your Information, our policy is to provide you with notice unless we are prohibited from
                      doing so by law or court order (including orders under 18 U.S.C. § 2705(b))
                      .</p>
                    <p>3. YOUR INFORMATION ACCESS, CHOICES AND CHANGES</p>
                    <p>We acknowledge the individual&rsquo;s right to access their personal information. Individuals wishing to review their data and edit or delete it, may do so contacting GREYRALLY via email at _____ or by mail at: _______, CA ___.<br />
                      You may opt out of receiving promotional emails from GREYRALLY by following the instructions in those emails. If you opt out, we may still send you non promotional emails, such as emails about your GREYRALLY account or our ongoing business relations. You may also send requests about your contact preferences or changes to your information, including requests to opt out of sharing your personal information with third parties, to our contact information below.<br />
                      Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Sites.</p>
                    <p>4. TERMINATION<br />
                      You may choose to disable your GREYRALLY account at any time. This means your user profile will no longer be visible on our site and Services. However, public reports and associated information that you&#39;ve submitted will still be available on GREYRALLY. For this reason, users can&#39;t entirely delete their accounts.<br />
                      If you violate GREYRALLY terms of service, we may unilaterally disable or delete your account. You agree to these terms of service when you create an account. If your account is disabled for any reason, you will no longer be under these terms.</p>
                    <p>5. DATA SECURITY<br />
                      GREYRALLY will use reasonable efforts to secure information submitted to us by our users. We protect your information using technical and administrative security measures to reduce the risks of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure and alteration. Some of the safeguards we use are firewalls and data encryption, physical access controls to our data centers, and information access authorization controls. We use encryption to protect data transmitted to and from our site. However, no data transmission over the internet is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of this data. You use the Services at your own risk, and are responsible for taking reasonable measures to secure your account (such as keeping your password secret).</p>
                    <p>6. CHILDREN UNDER 13<br />
                      Although our websites are general audience websites, GREYRALLY is not directed to people 12 and younger. We do not knowingly collect personal information from users in this age group. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will delete that information.</p>
                    <p>7. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER<br />
                      If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide Your Information to us, we may transfer Your Information to the United States and process it there.</p>
                    <p>8. USER&#39;S CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS<br />
                      If you are a California resident, you may request and obtain from us, once a year, free of charge, a list of third parties, if any, to which we disclosed your Information for direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year and the categories of Your Information shared with those third parties. If you are a California resident and wish to obtain that information, please submit a request by sending us an email at privacy@GREYRALLY.com with &quot;California Privacy Rights&quot; in the subject line or by writing to us at GREYRALLY.</p>
                    <p>9. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY<br />
                      We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the Privacy Policy will govern our use of your information and will always be at https://www.GREYRALLY.com/privacy. If we make changes that we believe will substantially alter your rights, we will display a notice on our site before we make those changes.</p>
