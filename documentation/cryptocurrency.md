# CryptoCurrencies

## 1. Bitcoin:
Bitcoin is a form of digital currency, created and held electronically. No one controls it. Bitcoins aren’t printed, like dollars or euros – they’re produced by people, and increasingly businesses, running computers all around the world, using software that solves mathematical problems.

It’s the first example of a growing category of money known as cryptocurrency.

## 2.LiteCoin:

In 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto launched bitcoin as the world's first cryptocurrency. The code is open source, which means it can be modified by anyone and freely used for other projects. Many cryptocurrencies have launched with modified versions of this code, with varying levels of success.

Litecoin was announced in 2011 with the goal of being the 'silver' to bitcoin's 'gold'. At the time of writing, Litecoin  has the highest market cap of any mined cryptocurrency, after bitcoin.

## 3.Dash :

Dash ranks behind Bitcoin as the 6th biggest currency in terms of total market capitalization.

Bitcoin’s weaknesses include a block size limit that slows transaction processing time and a 10-minute block creation period that constricts Bitcoin’s real world transaction usage by users.

As an open source project, Bitcoin lacks a developer funding model, which leaves the development to be managed by volunteers or powerful interest groups.  Bitcoin also lacks a coherent governance mechanism that would allow for protocol changes to be easily agreed on and implemented.  The blockchain data validation is managed by low end-nodes on a voluntary basis, and there’s no financial incentive to upgrade to the latest hardware and software.

Bitcoin transactions also lack privacy. Data mining companies are becoming uncomfortably good at identifying the source of Bitcoin transactions.

As a result of these and other weaknesses, Bitcoin faces increasing barriers to market adoption and the dream of a true P2P electronic cash has been mired by endless debate and slow upgrades.

## 4. Eathereum

Like Bitcoin, Ethereum is a distributed public blockchain network. Although there are some significant technical differences between the two, the most important distinction to note is that Bitcoin and Ethereum differ substantially in purpose and capability. Bitcoin offers one particular application of blockchain technology, a peer to peer electronic cash system that enables online Bitcoin payments. While the Bitcoin blockchain is used to track ownership of digital currency (bitcoins), the Ethereum blockchain focuses on running the programming code of any decentralized application.

## 5. Monero

Unlike Bitcoin, where you need to take extra steps to achieve anonymity, Monero has privacy turned on as a default setting. Untraceable transactions and anonymity are baked into the protocol.

As a side effect of anonymous and untraceable transactions, Monero is more fungible than Bitcoin. Fungible simply means that you can’t tell apart one coin from the next. Bitcoins are subject to being tainted. For instance, if a particular exchange has been hacked, or funds are stolen, the hacked or stolen Bitcoins can be tracked and subsequently blacklisted by exchanges or vendors. This can make a percentage of Bitcoins unspendable, which is not ideal for a digital representation of cash. Monero’s inherent untraceability makes this a non-issue.
